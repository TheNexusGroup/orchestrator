## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **WebSocket Scalability**: Complex state synchronization across multiple connections
   - *Mitigation*: Implement Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
   
2. **Performance with Large Files**: Memory usage during file processing
   - *Mitigation*: Implement streaming and chunked processing
   
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: API exposed to public access
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive security audit and pen testing

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Advanced features may not work across all browsers
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement strategy
   
2. **Mobile Performance**: Complex UI may be slow on mobile devices
   - *Mitigation*: Performance budget and optimization
